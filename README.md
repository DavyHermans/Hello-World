# Hello-World
Here I will store ideas about future projects
I'm a father, teacher and hobyist (in that order for now). A few years ago i discovered the Raspberry Pi and started experimenting in small steps. This led me to wanting to learn more about programming. By now i have learned the very basics of Python3, html, css and JavaScript. For that purposed i used the sololearn app.
Now i am reading to take it to the next step.
On my list are the following RPi3 projects: making a bird house camera, remote controlling lights from my phone,opening and closing garage door, ... smart home stuff.
My goal is to have at least one project finished by the end of the summer.
